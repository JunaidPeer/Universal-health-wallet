# Universal-health-wallet

# INTRODUCTION:

Health records are the most important documents which are maintained by the health care facilities of an Individual. It contains all Doctor’s proceedings, Diagnostics and lab reports, etc.
In response to this EHR was introduced; EHR stands for Electronic Health Records, which are electronic patient data/records maintained by hospitals for easy diagnostics and treatments to improve and streamline data entered into each patient’s permanent healthcare file.

# Limitations of EHR:

Limited designed Interference, Data security risks, and privacy,
Expensive technology, Restricted interference, and interoperability.

# Objective:

To create a solution that engages the Creation and Storage of EHRs in an easy, fast secure way solving problems of data security and privacy by introducing sudoanomisation, and cheap cost with Interoperability among, health care facilities, patients, and other medical networks(eg- medical stores, labs, insurance companies). Making it a Patient-centric care system, by sharing data with the consent of the patient.]

# Innovation:

Integrating electronic health records with Blockchain. Blockchain is simply defined as a decentralized, distributed ledger that is recorded cryptographically. By inherent design, the data on a blockchain is unable to be modified. Using one of the Most Secure Blockchain-Ethereum’s ERC-721 and ERC-1400 Token standards, the patient data is to be converted into JSON-Metadata format and be minted as a non-fungible token on EVM chains, thus allowing all fixes and integration with many other platforms.

# Methodology:

The process starts with assigning a user an evm wallet which is used to be a universal health wallet that should be linked with Social security number/ Aadhaar number (India). This gives instant access to previous treatment history and health records of patients, thereby facilitating the initiation of treatment.
Each Record of the patient is to be converted into JSON-Metadata format by simple Dapp (decentralized application) and to be minted as a Non-fungible Token (Erc-721) on evm chains, making it an easy way of storage and access of records without the private databases.
Each token(records in our case) will be minted by the health care facilities to the Patients wallet.

# Results & Conclusion:

The Universal Health Wallet would ensure the initiation of  treatment for the patient on time, saving a life, avoiding the cumbersome process of record creation, accessibility and authorization.

# RoadMap:
1.Integration with health care facilities and setting them up as Verified Hospital network.

2.Running a side-chain were users can share their data to the insurance companies by their will and earn decentralized funds/payments.

3.Integration with Unstoppable Domain's, allowing users to login with their ENS.

4.Future Integration include Connection with BrightID, Safelvalut, Lit Protocol, etc.
